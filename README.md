We participated in the Kaggle competition focused on predicting problem-atic internet usage organized by the Child Mind Institute from Sep 19,2024, to Dec 19, 2024. Our task involved creating a model trained onhigh-frequency data collected from wrist-worn accelerometers, and demographic and physical measures to predict the Severity Impairment Index(SII). Throughout the competition, we explored traditional machine learn-ing models, deep learning architectures for tabular data, and image classifi-cation using neural networks. The most successful results were achieved using traditional machine learning methods, particularly boosting algo-rithms. However, the deep learning tabular method —Neural ObliviousDecision Ensembles (NODE)—provided similar performance. Using actig-raphy data gather from wearable devices transform into daily images topredict SII has a high potential, especially to discern Severe SII.
